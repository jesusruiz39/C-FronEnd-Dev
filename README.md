**Hi, my name is Jesus Ruiz.
I'm a computer engineer student and frint end developer student.**

This is a basic Front end course, which I'm uploading to my gitHub to be able to practice git, and somehow have my notes somewhere.


*Here I will leave some photos of what I am doing, in this course, I promise to update when I can :)*
